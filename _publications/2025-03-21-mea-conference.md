This research will be presented at the **MEA’s 89th Annual Meetings** in **Kansas City, Missouri**, from **March 21–23, 2025**. The study examines how **Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU)** affects infrastructure financing choices between **Project Finance** and **General Corporate Finance**.  

### Abstract  
Infrastructure can be financed in two ways:  
1. **Project Finance**: Involves a **Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)**, legally distinct from the sponsor, providing higher verifiability of cashflows but limited recourse to the sponsor’s assets.  
2. **General Corporate Finance**: Allows recourse to sponsor’s assets but with lower control over project-specific cashflows.  

Using loan-level data from **Dealscan** across **22 countries** over **20 years**, this study finds:  
- **Overall funding for infrastructure projects decreases** during periods of high EPU.  
- The proportion of **Project Finance deals** (by number and value) falls in times of high EPU.  
- Lenders prefer recourse to sponsor’s assets during uncertain times, valuing this over cashflow verifiability.  

These effects are more pronounced in countries with **higher GDP per capita** and **high bank debt-to-GDP ratios**. The results remain robust under alternative definitions of **Project Finance** and **General Corporate Finance**.  

The findings offer critical insights for policymakers and financial institutions on the impact of economic uncertainty on infrastructure funding mechanisms.
