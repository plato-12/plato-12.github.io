This paper explores the **connectedness between edible oils and oilseeds** across international commodity markets and their relationship with the U.S. Economic Policy Uncertainty (EPU) Index. Utilizing the **TVP-VAR method**, it uncovers the inter-commodity spillover dynamics and highlights the influence of geopolitical and economic crises on connectedness levels.  

Key findings include:  
- A moderate level of connectedness among the studied commodities during stable periods.  
- Significant spikes in connectedness during times of crisis.  
- Soybean emerges as the most influential commodity, significantly affecting others in the edible oil market.  

The analysis is based on daily closing prices of near-month contracts of six edible oil commodities, spanning **January 2013 to April 2023**.
