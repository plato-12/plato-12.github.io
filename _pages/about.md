Hey there! I'm Priyanshu Tiwari, a senior undergraduate student at IIT Kanpur. My academic journey? It's been a wild ride exploring the crossroads of quantitative finance, machine learning, and economics—with a major soft spot for auction theory and game theory (iykyk).

Just wrapped up an internship at BNY Mellon, where I got to flex as a Software Developer in their Asset Servicing Engineering team. Definitely caught some valuable industry insights there!

When I'm not drowning in code or financial models, you'll catch me behind my camera shooting moody monochrome photography (aesthetic, right?). Total film nerd too—anything from Scorsese and Tarantino to Nolan has me in my feels. And my Spotify? Full of indie-jazz and alternative R&B that absolutely no one has heard of. 

Let's connect and create something cool together!
