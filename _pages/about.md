Hi there! I’m Priyanshu Tiwari, a senior undergraduate at IIT Kanpur. My academic journey has led me to explore exciting intersections of quantitative finance, machine learning for neuroscience, and economics—with a special interest in auction theory and game theory. Currently, I’m diving into efficiently pricing Asian options and applying computational methods to tackle real-world problems.

Previously, I had the privilege of interning at BNY Mellon, where I worked as a Software Developer in their Asset Servicing Engineering team, crafting scalable solutions for data-driven decision-making.

Beyond academics, I’m a passionate photographer, drawn to the timeless elegance of monochrome imagery. You’ll often find me immersed in films by Martin Scorsese, Quentin Tarantino, or Christopher Nolan, or vibing to indie-jazz and alternative R&B tracks that fuel my creativity.
